Kennedy I&amp;#039;m the only woman on staff for the Windy City Warriors, and after years of putting up with a sexist lead doctor, I&amp;#039;m desperate to land my dream job with a new team next year. All I have to do is maintain my professional reputation for my final season in Chicago. But a Las Vegas run-in with the team&amp;#039;s shortstop threatens it all, leaving me with a fuzzy memory and a ring on my left hand. Now, not only am I legally bound to the most persistent man I&amp;#039;ve ever met, but thanks to Isaiah&amp;#039;s scheme to save my job, I have to pretend the whole thing was a planned elopement and not a drunken mistake. Isaiah Rhodes is reckless, impulsive, and frustratingly charming. He&amp;#039;s also my brand-new husband. They got the saying wrong. What happens in Vegas doesn&amp;#039;t always stay in Vegas... sometimes it follows you right back home. Isaiah As the shortstop for Chicago&amp;#039;s professional baseball team, I&amp;#039;ve had my fair share of fun. But that all ended the day Kennedy Kay became a single woman. I&amp;#039;ve crushed on the team&amp;#039;s athletic trainer for years. I&amp;#039;ve flirted to no avail, so imagine my surprise when I woke up in Sin City with a ring on my finger and my favorite redhead in my bed. We agree to stay married for one baseball season, just long enough to keep her job safe, but in my mind, I&amp;#039;m using our time together to prove to her I&amp;#039;m husband material. Kennedy might be reluctant to join in on our game, but it&amp;#039;s one I refuse to lose. So come on, wife... play along.
