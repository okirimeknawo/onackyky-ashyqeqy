A new standalone legal thriller from the international bestselling author of GONE, BUT NOT FORGOTTEN. Charlie Webb is a third rate lawyer who graduated from a third rate law-school and, because he couldn‚Äôt get hired by any of the major law firms, has opened his own law firm, where he gets by handling cases for dubious associates from his youth and some court appointed cases. Described as ‚Äúa leaky boat floating down the stream of life,‚Äù Charlie has led unremarkable life, personally and professionally. Until he‚Äôs appointed to be the attorney for a decidedly crackpot artist who calls himself Guido Sabatini (born Lawrence Weiss). Sabatini has been arrested ‚Äì again ‚Äì for breaking into a restaurant and stealing back a painting he sold them because he was insulted by where it was displayed. But as Lawrence Weiss, he‚Äôs also an accomplished card shark and burglar and while he was there, he stole a thumb drive from the owner‚Äôs safe. Not knowing what else Sabatani has stolen, Webb negotiates the return of the painting and ‚Äúother items‚Äô for the owner dropping charges against Sabatini. But the contents of the flash drive threatens very powerful figures who are determined to retrieve it, the restaurant owner (Gretchen Hall) and her driver (Yuri Makarov) are being investigated for the sex trafficking of minors, and there are others who have a violent grudge against Sabatini. When a minor theft case becomes a double homicide, and even more, Charlie Webb, an insignificant lawyer assigned to an insignificant case, is faced with the most important, and deadliest, case of his life. Going back to his long-time bestselling roots, Phillip Margolin returns with a brilliant standalone legal thriller in the tradition of John Grisham.
