Tom Siddell’s acclaimed, long-running webcomic comes to Dark Horse with this special, limited edition hardcover, featuring a signed and numbered tip-in.
 
 After the death of her mother and her father’s disappearance, a young girl arrives at a mysterious boarding school.
 
 While the curriculum seems to be focused on advancing science and technology, Antimony “Annie” Carver quickly discovers that the grounds are home to plenty of things that science can’t explain: ghosts, supernatural phenomena, and even the gods of the neighboring forest. Along with her friend Kat, Annie begins to unravel the mysteries of her new home, Gunnerkrigg Court, which may not actually be a school after all.
 
 This collection features new cover art by Siddell, updated interior art, and includes chapters 1–22.
