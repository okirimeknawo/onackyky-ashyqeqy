Overview
&quot;Witty, wise, and disarmingly tender. I am hopelessly devoted to this summer dream of a book.&quot; â€”Becky Albertalli, New York Times bestselling author of Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda

Dahlia Adler&#039;s Cool for the Summer is a story of self-discovery and new love. Itâ€™s about the things we want and the things we need. And itâ€™s about the people who will let us be who we are.

 Lara&#039;s had eyes for exactly one person throughout her three years of high school: Chase Harding. He&#039;s tall, strong, sweet, a football star, and frankly, stupid hot. Oh, and he&#039;s talking to her now. On purpose and everything. Maybe...flirting, even? No, wait, he&#039;s definitely flirting, which is pretty much the sum of everything Lara&#039;s wanted out of life.

 Except sheâ€™s haunted by a memory. A memory of a confusing, romantic, strangely perfect summer spent with a girl named Jasmine. A memory that becomes a confusing, disorienting present when Jasmine herself walks through the front doors of the school to see Lara and Chase chatting it up in front of the lockers.

 Lara has everything she ever wanted: a tight-knit group of friends, a job that borders on cool, and Chase, the boy of her literal dreams. But if she&#039;s finally got the guy, why can&#039;t she stop thinking about the girl?
