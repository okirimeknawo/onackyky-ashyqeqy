On the mystical island of Miakatua, Leilani has always felt at home with her tight-knit family and their closest neighbors-especially Tavita, who&amp;#039;s been like a second father to her. But when an ancient destiny awakens within her, Leilani discovers she&amp;#039;s part of a powerful werewolf bloodline and a member of the secretive Crimson Robed Society. Even more shocking? Her fated mate is none other than Tavita himself. Now Leilani must navigate not only her newfound supernatural heritage but also her conflicted feelings for a man who helped raise her-and the devastating impact their bond will have on his marriage to her best friend&amp;#039;s mother. As she struggles to find her place within the pack, a dark force lurking in the island&amp;#039;s enchanted forest threatens everything she&amp;#039;s come to hold dear.
