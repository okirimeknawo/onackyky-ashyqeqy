Preorder now and receive the stunning LIMITED EDITION while supplies last¬†- featuring gorgeous sprayed edges and an exclusive spine design. Five years ago, he broke her heart. Now, he&amp;#039;ll do anything to win her back. When Farrah walked into her lunch meeting, she didn&amp;#039;t expect to see him: Blake Ryan. Her first love. Her first heartbreak. And now, her first client as a freelance interior designer. It&amp;#039;s been five years, but she&amp;#039;ll never forget the way he shattered her. He whispers pretty words, but she&amp;#039;ll never believe him. Her body craves his, but she&amp;#039;ll never give him her heart. Not again. Not ever. *** Money. Looks. A booming sports bar empire. On the surface, Blake has it all. But inside, he&amp;#039;s haunted‚Äîboth by nightmares of a tragic loss, and dreams of the girl he once betrayed. When fate reunites them, he sees it as a sign: It&amp;#039;s time to get the love of his life back. No matter what it takes.
